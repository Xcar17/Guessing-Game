## Project description

This script created in Perl is a Guessing Game where the user attempts to guess a number. The script generates a random positive number from a range of values determined by the user. The user will be given an option to quit the game after the first failed guess and after every third failed guessing attempt. If the user decides to quit the game without correctly guessing the number, the correct number will be printed to the screen before exiting the game.

## How to run the program
